<a href="./about.html">About the presenter</a> 
<p class="p1"> Welcome one and all to my presentation!</p>
<p class=p1> Today we will be discussing a subject, and industry and a history that I deeply passionate about and this is the world of Aviation!
    Ever since I was a wee lad I have always had a deep passion for those giant metal tubes I'd see in the sky, as I grew older my passion only 
    grew stronger to the point where I can call myself a professional "Avgeek".
